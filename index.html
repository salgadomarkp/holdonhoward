            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <h5>The Band</h5>
            <p>
                Hold on Howard is a Lehigh-Valley based pop punk band officially formed in 2019. It 
                consists of lead vocalist Zach Hartrum, lead guitarist Matthew Hager, rhythm guitarist 
                Kyle Clark, bassist Mark Salgado, and drummer Dimitri Pandelios. We take influence
                from bands such as Green Day, Nirvana, Mayday Parade, Jimmy Eat World, The Ramones,
                and Good Charlotte.
            </p>
            <h5>Zach Hartrum</h5>
            <p>
                Zach was born in New Jersey. He was heavily influenced by his father's love for music.
                He joined his first band in junior high school. Zach says that was the first time he was
                actually passionate about something besides video games.
            </p>
            <h5>Matthew Hager</h5>
            <h5>Kyle Clark</h5>
            <h5>Mark Salgado</h5>
            <p>
                Mark was born in the Lehigh Valley. He grew up surrounded by music and fell asleep to The
                Who as a baby. He began playing bass at the age of 16 and joined his first band shortly
                thereafter. Mark cites Rush's Geddy Lee as one of his biggest influences. Aside from music, 
                he takes interest in sports, aviation, and writing.
            </p>
            <h5>Dimitri Pandelios</h5>
            <p>
                Dimitri was also born in the Lehigh Valley. Like the other band members, he grew up in a
                musical family with his father and sister. He started out on bass and guitar, but began
                regular drum lessons while he was in middle school. Dimitri's favorite drummer is Travis
                Barker from blink-182. Aside from music, Dimitri enjoys watching movies.
