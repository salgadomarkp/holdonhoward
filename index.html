            <p>
                Hold on Howard is a Lehigh-Valley based pop punk band officially formed in 2019. It 
                consists of lead vocalist Zach Hartrum, guitarist Kyle Clark, bassist Mark Salgado, and 
                drummer Dimitri Pandelios. Their influences include bands such as Green Day, Nirvana, Mayday 
                Parade, Jimmy Eat World, The Ramones, and Good Charlotte.

            <h5 id="zach">Zach Hartrum</h5>
            <img src="images/zach.jpg">
            <p>
                Zach was born in New Jersey. He was heavily influenced by his father's love for music.
                He joined his first band in junior high school. Zach says that was the first time he was
                actually passionate about something besides video games.

            <h5 id="kyle">Kyle Clark</h5>
            <img src="images/kyle.jpg">
            <p>
                Kyle has his roots in metal, rock, and punk. He has been influenced by his father's
                interest in bands such as Metallica, Nirvana, and The Offspring. Kyle began by producing
                his own electronic music before deciding to learn the guitar.
            </p>
            <h5 id="mark">Mark Salgado</h5>
            <img src="images/mark.jpg">
            <p>
                Mark was born in the Lehigh Valley. He grew up surrounded by music and fell asleep to The
                Who as a baby. He began playing bass at the age of sixteen and joined his first band shortly
                thereafter. Mark cites Rush's Geddy Lee as one of his biggest influences. Aside from music, 
                he takes interest in sports, aviation, and writing.
            </p>
            <h5 id="dimitri">Dimitri Pandelios</h5>
            <img src="images/dimitri.jpg">
            <p>
                Dimitri was also born in the Lehigh Valley. Like the other band members, he grew up in a
                musical family with his father and sister. He started out on bass and guitar, but began
                regular drum lessons while he was in middle school. Dimitri's favorite drummer is Travis
                Barker from blink-182. Aside from music, Dimitri enjoys watching movies.
